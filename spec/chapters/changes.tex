\chapter{Change Log}

\section{Changes Since 2.0 Early Draft (Second Edition)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Section \ref{entity_providers}: Removed steps that required the use of the JavaBeans Activation Framework\cite{jaf} to map objects to representations and vice-versa. The EG deemed this feature to be confusing and not portable across implementations.
\item Section \ref{method_exc}: Clarified that steps must be followed in order and that throwables are propagated to the underlying container only if they cannot be mapped.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes Since 2.0 Early Draft (Second Edition)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Section \ref{uritemplates}: New example showing a scenario in which a \code{@PathParam} is not be available for injection. 
\item Section \ref{request_matching}: Formalization of certain parts of the matching algorithm that were vague. Defined formal ordering between media types and highlighted situations in which implementations should report a warning if the matching is ambiguous. 
\item Section \ref{request_matching}: New sample showing the resource matching algorithm in action.
\item Section \ref{template_to_regex}: New footnote about syntax of regular expression.
\item Chapter \ref{providers}: The annotation \Provider\ is now only required for automatic discovery of providers (typically via class scanning). It is no longer required for a provider that is manually registered in classes such as \code{Application} or \code{Configuration}.
\item Section \ref{automatic_discovery}: New section about automatic discovery of provider classes. Only those annotated with \Provider\ must be discovered automatically.
\item Chapter \ref{client_api}: Features are now providers and can be registered as such. A feature can no longer be disabled.
\item Chapter \ref{client_api}: Class \code{Target} renamed to \WebTarget. Removed text describing how to use a builder factory class (no longer supported). A few other minor updates and typos fixed.
\item Chapter \ref{filters_and_interceptors}: Extension points for filters revised. New filter interfaces \ClientRequestFilter\ and \ClientResponseFilter\ in Client API and new filter interfaces \ContainerRequestFilter\ and \ContainerResponseFilter\ in Server API. Corresponding context classes also updated in chapter. A \ContainerRequestFilter\ is executed before resource matching unless annotated with \PostMatching. It is no longer possible to share a filter implementation between the Client and Server APIs; entity interceptors are still shareable.
\item Chapter \ref{filters_and_interceptors}: Section on the relationship between filters and entity interceptors (including diagram) dropped.
\item Section \ref{global_binding}: Clarified global binding in relation to the new semantics of \Provider\ for automatic discovery.
\item Section \ref{dynamic_binding}: The \code{DynamicBinding} interface, intended to be implemented by filters and entity interceptors, is replaced by \code{DynamicBinder}. A dynamic binder is a new type of provider that binds filters and entity interceptors with resource methods. 
\item Section \ref{constraint_annotations}: Use media type names instead of Java constants for clarity.
\item Section \ref{entity_validation}: More descriptive names for constraint annotations.
\item Section \ref{annotation_inheritance}: Changed inheritance rules for constraint annotations to follow those defined in \cite{bv11}.
\item Section \ref{validation_phases_and_error_reporting}: New note about \code{@Valid} support for return values. Fixed phase number typo.
\item Section \ref{suspend_annotation}: New sentence about calling \code{suspend} more than once or in a method annotated with \code{@Suspend}.
\item Section \ref{async_ejbs}: New section about EJB resource classes with methods annotated with \code{@Asynchronous}.
\item Chapter \ref{environment}: Re-structured chapter with sub-sections for each of the EE technologies with which \jaxrs\ integrates. New examples added.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Section \ref{expert_group}: Updated 2.0 expert group member list.
\item Section \ref{acks}: Updated acknowledgements for 2.0 version.
\item Section \ref{exceptions_providers}: New section that describes exception handling for all providers. Related changes to reference this new section.
\item Section \ref{exceptions_filters_and_interceptors}: New section for filter and interceptor exceptions. Related changes to reference this new section.
\item Section \ref{request_matching}: Updated step 2a so that it only goes to step 3 when $M \neq \{\}$. 
\item Section \ref{request_matching}: New sentence about the use of a server quality parameter (qs-value) during request matching.
\item Chapter \ref{filters_and_interceptors}: New extension point for pre-match filters that are executed before resource matching.
\item Chapter \ref{filters_and_interceptors}: Filter methods no longer return a next action; the execution of a request filter chain is stopped by setting a response in the associated context.
\item Chapter \ref{filters_and_interceptors}: Handlers renamed to entity interceptors for clarity (in this log included).
\item Section \ref{global_binding}: Global binding is now the default for filters and entity interceptors. The annotation \code{@GlobalBinding} has been dropped.
\item Section \ref{priorities}: Clarified reverse ordering of the response filter chain based on binding priorities.
\item Appendix C: Removed from this version after changes to Chapter \ref{filters_and_interceptors}.
\item Chapter \ref{validation}: Moved to an instantiate-then-validate strategy in which validation of constructor parameters and setters is no longer supported.
\item Section \ref{validation_phases_and_error_reporting}: Simplified validation process to better align with Bean Validation 1.1 \cite{bv11}. In particular, validation of resource classes, fields and property getters are all carried out in a single step.

\end{itemize}
