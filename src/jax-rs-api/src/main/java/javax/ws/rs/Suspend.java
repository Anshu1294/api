/**
 * Marks a request processed by the {@code @Suspend}-annotated {@link HttpMethod JAX-RS resource method}
 * for suspending. Suspended request processing can be resumed using an injectable
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.core.ExecutionContext} instance bound to the processed request:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Path("/messages/next")
 * public class SimpleAsyncEventResource {
 *     private static final BlockingQueue&lt;ExecutionContext&gt; suspended = new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;ExecutionContext&gt;(5);
 *     &#64;Context ExecutionContext ctx;
 *
 *     &#64;GET
 *     &#64;Suspend
 *     public void pickUpMessage() throws InterruptedException {
 *         suspended.put(ctx);
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;POST
 *     public String postMessage(final String message) throws InterruptedException {
 *         suspended.take().resume(message);
 *         return "Message sent";
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Typically resource method annotated with {@code @Suspend} annotation declare
 * {@code void} return type, but it is not a hard requirement to do so. Any response
 * value returned from the {@code @Suspend}-annotated resource method is ignored
 * by the framework:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Path("/messages/next")
 * public class SimpleAsyncEventResource {
 *     &hellip;
 *     &#64;GET
 *     &#64;Suspend
 *     public String pickUpMessage() throws InterruptedException {
 *         suspended.put(ctx);
 *         return "This response will be ignored.";
 *     }
 *     &hellip;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * By default there is {@link #NEVER no suspend timeout set} and request processing is
 * suspended indefinitely. The suspend timeout can be specified using the annotation
 * values. Declaratively specified timeout can be further overridden using one
 * of the {@code suspend(...)} methods in the {@link javax.ws.rs.core.ExecutionContext}
 * programmatic API.
 * <p/>
 * If the request processing was suspended with a positive timeout value, the
 * processing will be resumed once the specified timeout threshold is reached
 * provided the request processing was not explicitly resumed before the
 * suspending has expired. The request processing will be resumed using response
 * data returned by the associated {@link javax.ws.rs.core.ExecutionContext#getResponse()}
 * method. Should the method return {@code null}, a {@link WebApplicationException}
 * is raised with a HTTP 503 error status (Service unavailable). Use
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.core.ExecutionContext#setResponse(java.lang.Object)}
 * method to programmatically customize the default timeout response.
 * <p/>
 * The annotation is ignored if it is used on any method other than JAX-RS
 * resource method.
